# SparkSqlExample

A Spark SQL example that generates employee and salary data based on given inputs and calculates the top 3 salaries per department.

Check SalaryAnalyzer for how to generate data. Right now salaries are generated randomly over a base salary, which results in random salaries for every salary date (which is obviously not realistic).
